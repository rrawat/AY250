AY 250, HW3: Computer Vision
Radhika Rawat

---------------------------
There are 2 other items in this submission:

The program (HW3.py)
An example training folder
---------------------------

To run HW3.py, you'll have to enter: run HW3.py /path_of_testing_files 

(The run command, a space, and then the path to the folder of the validation set)

In line ___ of HW3,py, you'll have to enter the path to the training set. You can use the one I've provided in the folder or a different one, but it has to be put into the program as a path to the folder that contains the images. It is assumed that the folder contains *only* images. It is also assumed that the path contains no underscores, because underscores are used to determine the real classes of the images, for accuracy checking.

The three most useful feature sets were object count, distance mapping, and local maximum determination.

There are 25 features.
