GUI.py opens a window where the user can type in search terms, view the resulting image's url, and alter the image using the action buttons.

After entering the search terms and hitting "Search", the first image returned by Google Image Search is downloaded to the directory, and is then made available for editing. The alterations are : rotate (rotate 90 degrees clockwise), flip (flip horizontally), and invert (invert the colors).
